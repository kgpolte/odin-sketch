# odin-sketch

A very simple sketching app built for The Odin Project.

Probably needs further testing to ensure user input gets validated.

## Features
- 600px by 600px canvas
- Adjustable canvas resolution (10 to 50 cells per side)
- Drawing opacity of 10% (non-adjustable for now)
- Canvas reset button
